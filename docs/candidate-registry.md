Plans: BASIC $0/250mo, PRO $3.99/3,500mo, ULTRA $9.99/25,000mo, MEGA $24.99/50,000mo hard. Proxy gate verified. KEY GATE CLEARED 2026-10-29: user added GEMINI_API_KEY in the Render dashboard; model set to gemini-3.6-flash (2.5-flash retired for new users, 3.8-flash too slow) in env and code (commit 002e4d20); AI engine verified end to end through the proxy gate (engine "gemini", names preserved). PUBLISHED LIVE 2026-10-29 on his tap ("Publish it" in the voice call). Hub https://rapidapi.com/YamilLittle/api/swiftrewrite.

PUBLISH AUTHORIZED by the user 2026-10-29 (full-run voice authorization; the earlier per-build tap gate is lifted for this build). Remaining launch steps, run via the parent's browser tasks: Studio listing (PRIVATE first), proxy-secret wiring with gate verification (401/200), publish public, Hub gateway test, Spotlight post from docs/wordbase-accuracy.md via its GitHub blob URL. PUBLISHED LIVE 2026-10-29: https://rapidapi.com/YamilLittle/api/wordbase-dictionary (Studio API ID api_318c4e4a-2979-49cd-8e9f-91f2d04046f9).

BUILT AND DEPLOYED 2026-10-29 as SwiftTranslate (swifttranslate/app.py, spec docs/spec-swifttranslate.md, Spotlight doc docs/swifttranslate-reliability.md ready, not posted). Render srv-dbhfe08n74is73d8e020, https://swifttranslate-72rx.onrender.com (Render suffixed the subdomain; the bare name was taken globally). Gemini 3.6 Flash wrapper on the incumbent's v2 surface (/language/translate/v2, /detect, /languages; same response envelope), 107 languages, 24h cache with stale-on-error, one engine retry, explicit JSON errors. Engine verified pre-launch through the connector with the production payload (es to en correct with proper names intact ~4.1s, fr detect ~2.6s; two transient Google 503s observed, hence the retry). Plans: BASIC $0/1,000mo, PRO $0/10,000mo (their $9 Pro free), ULTRA $9/100,000mo, MEGA $29/500,000mo hard. PARKED 2026-10-29 at the key step per the user's rule update (SKIPPED AT THE KEY STEP; explicitly not a blocker, the queue moves on): (1) GEMINI_API_KEY must be added to the swifttranslate Render env by the user, a one-minute step (same as SwiftRewrite; deployed /health re-verified reporting "awaiting key", translate/detect return an explicit 503 until then); (2) the Studio listing (PRIVATE first; full listing content ready in listings/swifttranslate-openapi.json), proxy-secret wiring with gate verification, publish, Hub gateway test (engine "gemini"), and Spotlight post from docs/swifttranslate-reliability.md (description condensed to 228 chars per the 280-char platform limit) remain, run via the parent's browser tasks.

| 10 | Whois Lookup (Zozor54) | 3,811 | 3/5 (16) | $10/$30/$80 | Pro FREE; $20/$70 | 63 | WAVE 4, live-verified 2026-10-29. Service level 99%, latency 1,371ms. 29 Discussion threads, every one listed Unanswered. Themes: stale cached results (users report records wrong for hours despite the force flag), timeouts and 504s, missing/blank/null data for many TLDs (.dev, .at, .rs, .pl, .eu, .fi and more), double-subscription billing. BUILT AND DEPLOYED 2026-10-29 as WhoisBase (whoisbase/app.py, spec docs/spec-whoisbase.md, Spotlight doc docs/whoisbase-freshness.md ready, not posted; listing package listings/whoisbase-openapi.json). Render srv-dbhl8lbbc2fs73epsfp0, https://whoisbase.onrender.com (the bare product name was available on both Render and the subdomain). Build state at handoff: BUILT AND DEPLOYED, awaiting the parent's Studio lane for listing, proxy-secret wiring, publish, gateway test, and Spotlight. Design answers the complaints in order: RDAP via the IANA bootstrap (1,203 TLDs live at deploy), port-43 fallback for the no-RDAP TLDs (whois.nic.at, whois.eu, whois.rnids.rs, whois.denic.de, whois.identity.digital, whois.nic.ch), 300s cache with a cache block on every response (cached flag, age_seconds, TTL) and fresh/force that genuinely bypasses, structured JSON errors only, unregistered domains return 200 registered:false. Local battery: port-43 parser 15/15 against canned .at/.eu/.rs records plus a local fake server; live RDAP records for .com/.dev/.pl/.fi/.org; Nominet .uk rate-limits the shared build-sandbox egress (429 surfaced as a structured error; succeeds when spaced). DEPLOYED VERIFICATION 2026-10-29: /health live (1,203 RDAP TLDs); RDAP records for google.com, web.dev, allegro.pl, finnair.fi; PORT-43 VERIFIED LIVE FROM RENDER (the sandbox blocks it, Render does not): nic.at (created 2000-08-25, 5 nameservers), eurid.eu (registrar EURid vzw, 6 nameservers), rnids.rs (registrar RNIDS, 6 nameservers after a parser fix for RNIDS's DNS-label format, commit 929fd827), example.de (status connect, DENIC restriction labeled in the response); deployed cache behavior verified (repeat call cached:true, fresh=true refetches, unregistered .com registered:false at the 60s negative TTL). Plans to save in Studio: BASIC $0/250mo, PRO $0/10,000mo (the incumbent's $10 Pro made free), ULTRA $20/100,000mo, MEGA $70/500,000mo hard (or platform maximum quotas at those prices). Keep-warm fleet is now ten services, window held at 09:00-11:00 ET (2h x 10 x 31 = 620h worst month vs the 750h cap). Known polish items, not launch blockers: .at registrant/registrar come back as registry handles (nic.at publishes handle blocks); .eu records carry no dates because EURid's port-43 record has none to give. |

## WATCHLIST

| Candidate | Subs | Why held |
|---|---|---|
| Alpha Vantage | 33,812 | Complaints are two 7-year-old forex threads; provider is the brand owner; overlaps EDGAR Fundamentals. |
| Weather (Api Dojo weather338) | 2,725 | Complaints are documentation/support only; 4/5 on 4 votes. |
| Twinword Sentiment Analysis | 1,900 | WAVE 3, live-verified: 5/5 rating rests on a single vote, so pain evidence is the two verified complaint themes only (bogus 711 quota errors, free-tier blocking). Pricing grid known from the provider's site, not yet read on RapidAPI itself. Score ~52. |
| Domains API (layered) | 1,327 | WAVE 4, live-verified 2026-10-29 (Overview only): 4/5 (8 votes), 91% service level, 821ms latency; pricing from the Overview: $0/$5/$10/$30 (full grid not read). Discussions NOT read, so pain is unverified; also overlaps the Whois Lookup queue pick (#10) in the same whois/domain space. Read Discussions before any scoring. |

## EXCLUDED (with reason)

| Candidate | Reason |
|---|---|
| WeatherAPI.com (52,194) | $0 pricing on RapidAPI: nothing to undercut. |
| CoinGecko (11,580) | Free tier only on RapidAPI. |
| Yahoo Finance by enclout (1,163) | Free tier only; Yahoo resale terms risk. |
| NFL API Data (3,450) | Sports data licensing. |
| Binance (Glavier), Telize, Jobs Scanner, Real Time Email Verification, ViewStats, real-estate scrapers | Below subscriber floor, no complaint pattern, or no free legal data route. |
| Flight data, entire category (wave 3) | OpenSky requires a paid license for commercial use; AeroDataBox terms ban resale on every plan; ADSBexchange is non-commercial only. No $0 terms-clean route exists. |
| Phone validation, entire category (wave 3) | The HLR trap: the paid value is live carrier status; free libphonenumber covers format/region/allocation only. A clone would be a partial match by construction. |
| TMDB-based movie APIs (wave 3) | TMDB commercial use needs its $149/mo key. IMDb datasets are non-commercial; OMDb data is CC BY-NC. |
| PDF Generator (domware.apps) | Live-verified at 2 subscribers. Below floor. |
| URL To Screenshot (APILight) | Live-verified at 103 subscribers despite a real 11.9s latency wedge. Below floor. |
| Custom QR Code with Logo (qrcode-monkey) | Live-verified at 294 subscribers; verified 500-error complaints. Below floor. |
| Dad Jokes (API-Ninjas), Numbers API, barcode.monster, Screenshotlayer, Free IP Geolocation | Free tier only on RapidAPI. |
| Calendarific (ryancli) | Live-verified 2026-10-29 (wave 4): 550 subscribers, below the 1,000 floor. Not rated (2 votes). Pricing has paid tiers (Basic $0 / 500,000 per month; Pro $10 unlimited; Ultra $30 unlimited), but Discussions hold exactly 1 thread ("API support", 7 years old, unanswered, body not read), so the 2-complaint-theme criterion also fails. |
| Abstract IP geolocation (karmadele) | Live-verified 2026-10-29 (wave 4): 131 subscribers, below floor; free-only on the Overview ($0 BASIC shown), not rated (0 votes), 100% service level, 251ms latency. |
| public-holidays7 (hefesto-technologies) | Lead not found 2026-10-29 (wave 4): direct listing URL returns API not found; hub searches for the name and provider returned no such listing. The community-post reference that suggested it appears to point at a removed or renamed listing. |
| Open Weather Map (cedricnoguera) | Live-verified 2026-10-29 (wave 4): 7,536 subscribers, 2/5 (16 votes), 100% service level, 335ms - but only a free Basic tier on RapidAPI ($0 / 500,000 per month), so nothing to undercut (same exclusion as WeatherAPI.com). Discussions hold a single complaint theme (invalid API key, 7 threads, all unanswered). |
| Whois by API-Ninjas (apininjas) | Live-verified 2026-10-29 (wave 4): 516 subscribers, below floor. 4/5 on 2 votes, 100% service level; only a $0 BASIC tier shown on the Overview. |

## WAVE 3 CALIBRATION NOTE (2026-10-28)

Utility APIs (PDF, screenshot, QR) concentrate at tiny subscriber counts
even when complaints are real (verified: 2, 103, 294). Demand concentrates
in data and content APIs. Future sweeps should weight categories
accordingly. Method note: listing pages are JavaScript-rendered, so
subscriber counts and ratings must be read in the live signed-in browser;
text fetching returns titles only. Complaint dossiers and pricing grids
are fetchable and were verified that way in wave 3.

## WAVE 4 SWEEP NOTE (2026-10-29, extra run ahead of the 2026-11-01 monthly run)

Outcome: ONE new candidate qualified and was scored - Whois Lookup
(Zozor54), QUEUED at #10 with score 63 (see the queue table). Both
browser reports arrived after the run's first summary and were folded
in the same morning; the final state below supersedes every interim
note. Calendarific (550 subs) and Abstract IP geolocation (131 subs,
free-only) were fully read live and FAIL the floor - recorded in
EXCLUDED with their verified figures. Whois by API-Ninjas (516 subs)
is Excluded below the floor; Open Weather Map by cedricnoguera
(7,536 subs, 2/5) is Excluded because its RapidAPI listing is
free-tier-only; Domains API (1,327 subs) sits in WATCHLIST with its
Discussions unread. Still VERIFICATION PENDING for the 2026-11-01
run: the largest IP geolocation listing, the largest holidays
listing, and the largest OCR listing (search cards seen, figures
never read). Hub searches run: holidays, Public Holidays,
Calendarific, hefesto, public-holidays7, IP geolocation, abstractapi,
whois, Open Weather Map. Holidays search cards (figures NOT verified,
largest holidays API not determined): Public holidays by Data And
Apis, Public Holidays by StandingAPI, Working days by JoursOuvres.
IP geolocation search cards (figures NOT verified, largest not
determined): IP GEO Location by FutureAPI, Telize by Frederic Cambus,
IP Geolocation by IPWHOIS.io, IP Info by NeutrinoAPI, ipstack by
Idera Dev Tools. OCR, Spoonacular/recipe, translator alternatives,
news alternatives, metals, air quality, and trivia were in the sweep
brief but no listing in those categories was reached for verification
this run.

Build routes pre-verified this run (sources checked 2026-10-29), ready
to apply the moment an incumbent verifies:
- Holidays: python-holidays and holidata are MIT-licensed (100+
  countries, subdivisions) = clean $0 route. Nager.Date's hosted API is
  NOT the route (commercial use asks sponsorship; its offline package
  needs a license key).
- Whois: RDAP via the IANA bootstrap (data.iana.org/rdap/dns.json) is a
  free public protocol with structured JSON = clean $0 route.
- IP geolocation: MaxMind GeoLite2's standard EULA bars serving
  geolocation to third parties without a paid Commercial Redistribution
  License (a resale trap). Partial clean routes exist with attribution:
  DB-IP Lite (CC BY), IP2Location LITE (free for commercial use, about
  98% country / 60% city accuracy), IPLocate country+ASN (CC BY-SA).
  Partial-match risk, same shape as the phone-validation exclusion.
- Weather: Open-Meteo's hosted API is non-commercial on its free tier;
  its data is CC BY 4.0 and its code AGPLv3 (self-host), and NOAA data
  is public domain (US only) = contested/partial route.
- OCR: Tesseract is Apache 2.0 = clean, but heavy to host on the
  Render free tier.
- Air quality (no incumbent reached): OpenAQ data is CC BY 4.0,
  commercial use allowed with attribution = clean route.
- Trivia (no incumbent reached): OpenTDB is CC BY-SA 4.0,
  commercial-clean.
- Metals (no incumbent reached): the LBMA benchmark requires a
  redistribution license = contested.
