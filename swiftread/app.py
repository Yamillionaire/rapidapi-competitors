"""SwiftRead - article-to-speech API (the user's own product idea, 2026-10-30).

Give it an article URL (or raw text) and it returns spoken audio: the
"listen to this article" button as an API. Extraction is the lane's
proven stdlib stack, shared with CleanExtract (density-scored main
content, SSRF-hardened fetch, structured errors, never a bare 503).
Speech is synthesized with the free Microsoft Edge read-aloud neural
voices via the edge-tts package: zero marginal cost, no paid TTS, no
API key. Long text is chunked at sentence boundaries within paragraphs;
chunks synthesize in parallel (bounded pool) and the MP3 segments are
concatenated in reading order with a short silence beat between
paragraphs, so playback keeps the article's rhythm.

The shared scaffold (shared/rapidapi_server.py) speaks GET/JSON only,
so this service carries its own small server that keeps the scaffold's
exact conventions: the RapidAPI proxy-secret gate (401 JSON without
the X-RapidAPI-Proxy-Secret header, /health always open) and explicit
structured JSON errors for every failure that is not audio.

Endpoints:
  POST /read-url  {url, voice?, rate?}          -> audio/mpeg
  POST /speak     {text, voice?, rate?}         -> audio/mpeg
  GET  /voices                                  -> the curated voice list
  GET  /health                                  -> service status
Run: python3 app.py (PORT env, default 8112). Needs: pip install edge-tts.
