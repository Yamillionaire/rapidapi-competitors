# RapidAPI Competitor Services - Build Status

DEPLOYED LIVE 2026-10-28 (free Render plan, from the public repo
github.com/Yamillionaire/rapidapi-competitors, commit d3e7bf3):
- Currency: https://stablefx-currency-rates.onrender.com (srv-dbh1vrtg1s2s73ci2pa0)
- Email: https://cleanlist-email-verifier.onrender.com (srv-dbh1vtvf3r2c73atjoig)
- Financials: https://edgar-fundamentals.onrender.com (srv-dbh1vv8ae00c73dl7obg)
Live verification the same day: currency convert returned the 2026-10-28 ECB
rate (100 USD = 89.823 EUR) with warm cache latency 0ms server-side; the email
service loaded 224,300 disposable domains at runtime on Render and rejected
idwager.com while accepting a real Gmail address; financials returned AAPL's
19 annual revenue periods and a correct TSLA summary. Render is API-connected
as custom.render (helper in ~/workspace/custom-connectors/custom.render/bin).
Free-plan caveat: services spin down when idle, so a cold first request takes
about 1-2 seconds; warm requests are milliseconds. NEXT STEP: create the three
RapidAPI provider listings pointing at these base URLs, with pricing from the
specs, each shown to the user as a preview before publishing. RAPIDAPI_PROXY_SECRET
env vars get set on each service once the listings exist.

User directed 2026-10-28: build all three competitors (Currency, Email, Yahu Financials).
All three run on one shared zero-dependency Python scaffold (shared/rapidapi_server.py):
stdlib HTTP server, explicit JSON error objects (never a silent 204 or bare 500),
TTL cache with stale-on-error serving, optional RapidAPI proxy-secret check via
RAPIDAPI_PROXY_SECRET env. Zero dependencies means free-tier hosting anywhere
(Render free account is the planned deploy target) and instant cold starts.

## 1. currency/ - StableFX Currency Rates (vs fyhao Currency Exchange)
Endpoints: /latest, /convert, /historical, /currencies, /health.
Data: Frankfurter (ECB daily reference rates), Fawaz API fallback, last-good cache
served flagged stale instead of a 503. Honest label: daily reference, not trading quotes.
TESTED LIVE 2026-10-28:
- /latest USD: EUR 0.89686, GBP 0.7503 (2026-10-27 ECB day). Cold 1,267ms (upstream-bound).
- Same call warm from cache: 2ms. Incumbent's listed latency: 23,769ms at 22% service level.
- /convert 100 USD to EUR = 89.686. Correct.
- /historical 2024-01-15 returns that day's rates.
Pricing (from spec): Basic free 1,000/mo; Pro free 10,000/mo (hook); Ultra $10 (net $7.50);
Mega $20 (net $15). Incumbent: $10 / $20 / $30.
TERMS VERIFIED 2026-10-28: Frankfurter is open source (MIT) and its rates are
free for commercial use (ECB and central-bank reference data). Fawaz is the
fallback only. Deploy package ready (render.yaml at project root).
REMAINING: deploy to Render from the user's account, create RapidAPI provider
listing (user's account, preview first). Noted upgrade path: Frankfurter v2
covers 160+ currencies from 100+ central banks versus v1's ECB-only set.

## 2. emailcheck/ - CleanList Email Verifier (vs Top-Rated E-mail Check)
Endpoint: /check?email= with separately labeled checks: syntax, disposable,
MX/DNS via DNS-over-HTTPS, role account. Mailbox probing deliberately NOT faked:
it ships as a separate labeled mode later.
TESTED LIVE 2026-10-28 (5-case set, then re-tested after fixes, all passing):
- Real Gmail address: valid, low risk, MX found.
- mailinator.com address: rejected as disposable.
- Bad syntax: rejected.
- Non-existent domain: rejected, no MX/A records.
- example.com: rejected after fix - it publishes a null MX (RFC 7505, accepts no mail).
  First pass wrongly accepted it; the hard re-check caught it and the code was fixed.
UPDATE 2026-10-28: the full open disposable list is loaded (FFraud-com list, MIT
license, 224,300 domains in data/disposable_domains.txt, rebuilt upstream every
30 minutes; production refetches daily). Verified live: addresses at idwager.com
and bialode.com, the two domains the incumbent's own users publicly complained
it missed, are both REJECTED here; Gmail regression still passes.
REMAINING: accuracy test set publication, deploy, listing.
First production run is planned as the dogfood pass on the user's own email database.

## 3. financials/ - EDGAR Fundamentals (vs ApiDojo Yahu Financials)
Endpoints mirror the incumbent's paths: /stock/get-fundamentals, /stock/v2/get-timeseries.
Data: SEC EDGAR company-facts (free, public domain, no key), cached 24h.
TESTED LIVE 2026-10-28:
- AAPL annualTotalRevenues: 19 consecutive annual periods, 2007-2025, zero nulls,
  zero gaps after merging EDGAR's alias tags (filers changed revenue tags over the
  years; merging was required - the first pass had gaps in 2018-2020 and the
  re-check caught it). FY2018 = 265,595,000,000 and FY2020 = 274,515,000,000,
  matching Apple's reported figures exactly. All-periods revenue count: 36.
  Incumbent: series capped at 5, revenues null except the last period.
- TSLA annual revenues: 17 periods, 2009-2025.
- pegRatio returns an explicit explanation object plus a real trailing
  earningsGrowth5yrPct computed from filings (AAPL 7.39%), never a silent null.
FREE ENDPOINTS ADDED 2026-10-28 (user approved free-only launch the same day):
/stock/v2/get-summary serves company name, exchange, SIC industry, fiscal year
end and HQ from EDGAR (AAPL and TSLA verified live), filling the incumbent's
missing name/exchange complaint at $0. /stock/v2/get-recommendations serves
related tickers as SEC SIC industry peers (AAPL returns DELL, OMCL, OSS, OURA,
SCKT; method labeled in the response, not passed off as a popularity feed).
REMAINING (the one real cost decision, deferred by the user until revenue):
quotes/charts need a licensed feed whose
terms allow redistribution (Yahoo data is personal-use only, no commercial route
published). Feed pricing researched 2026-10-28 from the providers' own pages:
Tiingo publishes redistribution pricing on its product pages, $250/mo for
startups ($500 enterprise); its $50/mo Commercial plan is INTERNAL use only and
does not cover resale. Massive (formerly Polygon) marks every self-serve plan
individual use; its Business plan with a commercial license runs about
$2,000/mo. Financial Modeling Prep requires a separate Data Display and
Licensing Agreement (no self-serve price). PLAN: launch fundamentals-only at
$0 (that is where the incumbent's complaints and our proven fix are), and add
quotes only when the API's own subscription revenue covers the license
(breakeven roughly 17 Ultra subs at $15 net or 2 Mega at $217.50 net against a
$250/mo Tiingo startup redistribution tier), so the license is never an
out-of-pocket cost. Then build the quote endpoints and related tickers
(EDGAR industry peers), deploy, listing.

## 8. swifttranslate/ - SwiftTranslate (vs Hark Translate Google Translate)

BUILT AND DEPLOYED 2026-10-29 (queue #8, score 66; user authorized the full
automated queue run in a voice call). Render srv-dbhfe08n74is73d8e020,
https://swifttranslate-72rx.onrender.com (GitHub commit 8e8ed8a0). Endpoints
mirror the incumbent's v2 surface with the same response envelope:
GET /language/translate/v2 (q, target, optional source), /detect, /languages
(107 codes), /health. Engine: Gemini 3.6 Flash (2.5-flash retired for new
users; 3.8-flash too slow). Reliability design answers the incumbent's 84%
service level and its unanswered "API unreachable" complaint: explicit JSON
errors always, one engine retry, 24h cache serving stale (flagged) on engine
error. No key yet: translate/detect return an explicit 503
engine_not_configured; nothing is faked.
TESTED 2026-10-29: local no-key suite (health, languages, 503s, 422s with
limit-and-length wording, 5,001-char rejection), proxy gate (401 without
header, /health open), bad-key engine errors as explicit 502s; engine verified
with the production payload through the Gemini connector (Spanish to English
correct, proper names intact, ~4.1s; French detection ~2.6s; two transient
Google 503s observed during testing, hence the retry). Deployed /health live
and reporting the engine as awaiting configuration.
Pricing: BASIC $0/1,000mo; PRO $0/10,000mo (the incumbent's $9 tier, free);
ULTRA $9/100,000mo; MEGA $29/500,000mo, hard limits.
REMAINING: user adds GEMINI_API_KEY to this service's Render Environment
(same one-time step as SwiftRewrite), then the Studio listing (PRIVATE),
proxy secret + gate verification, publish, Hub gateway test, and the
Spotlight post (docs/swifttranslate-reliability.md) - all via the parent's
browser tasks. Keep-warm now covers nine services, 09:00-11:00 ET.

## 9. newsbase/ - NewsBase Headlines (vs BFD Google News)
Endpoints: /headlines, /search, /topic/{topic}, /source/{source}, /topics, /health.
Data: Google News RSS (editions, search, topic sections) plus direct outlet RSS
(BBC, NPR, The Guardian, Al Jazeera, NYT), $0, no key. Complaint fixes are the
product: feeds are parsed into records and serialized by us (valid JSON by
construction, never raw upstream passthrough), and there is no image proxy -
publisher image URLs are returned directly or the field is omitted.
DEPLOYED 2026-10-29: https://newsbase-headlines.onrender.com
(srv-dbhfe5o473hc739rmad0). TESTED LIVE the same day: 11 live checks plus the
16-case local set, every response strict-JSON-valid (27/27); GB and IN editions
return their own headlines; a BBC story's image is the BBC CDN URL itself and
answers HEAD 200 image/jpeg. Pricing (spec): Basic $0/250mo; Pro $15/10,000mo;
Ultra $40/75,000mo; Mega $90/300,000mo hard. Incumbent: $25/$50/$100.
REMAINING: Studio listing, proxy gate, publish, Spotlight (parent browser route;
package at listings/newsbase-openapi.json, proof doc docs/newsbase-reliability.md).

## Sequence
Currency deploy-ready first (done at prototype level), Email second, Financials
third once the quote feed is chosen. Nothing is published until the user approves
each listing preview. PayPal payout linking on RapidAPI is the user's own tap.

## wordbase/ - WordBase Dictionary (vs dpventures WordsAPI)
Built 2026-10-29 (Spec G, docs/spec-wordsapi-competitor.md). Endpoints mirror
WordsAPI: /words/{word} full record, per-relation endpoints (definitions,
synonyms, antonyms, examples, typeOf, hasTypes, partOf, hasParts, memberOf,
hasMembers, substanceOf, hasSubstances, similarTo, also, derivation,
pertainsTo, entails, cause), /pronunciation, /syllables, /frequency,
/rhymes, /words search, /health. Data: WordNet 3.1 + CMUdict + FrequencyWords
en_50k, all openly licensed, all downloaded at boot (WordNet tarball 16MB,
too large for the snapshot route). Synsets parse on demand from an offset
index (boot RSS about 151MB measured locally).
TESTED LOCALLY 2026-10-29 (all passing): health reports 147,478 lemmas,
126,052 pronunciations, 50,000 frequency words. serendipity returns the full
record (definition, typeOf, derivation, 5 syllables, IPA, zipf 2.54); run
returns 57 senses across noun and verb; dog typeOf, wheel partOf, car
hasParts all correct; cat rhymes derived from CMU; geese resolves to goose
and running to its base forms via the exception lists; unknown words return
a clean documented 404 JSON error; bank (18 senses) answers in about 9ms.
Pricing (planned, hard limits): BASIC $0/1,000mo, PRO $0/10,000mo (hook vs
incumbent $10), ULTRA $39/300,000mo (vs $49), MEGA $79/1,000,000mo (vs $89),
or the platform maximum at each price where RapidAPI caps lower.
Keep-warm final fleet state: nine services, window 09:00-11:00 ET
(2h x 9 x 31 = 558h worst month vs the 750 cap).
DEPLOYED 2026-10-29: GitHub commit a18d1c7f; Render service
wordbase-dictionary (srv-dbhfdb6c6qcc73f9geh0),
https://wordbase-dictionary.onrender.com, deploy live. Live test battery
matches the local results (health 147,478 lemmas; serendipity full
record; run 57 senses; clean 404s; search; morphology). The user
authorized the full launch run for this build on 2026-10-29 (publish
gate lifted): the Studio listing (PRIVATE first), proxy-secret wiring
with gate verification, publish, Hub gateway test, and Spotlight post
from docs/wordbase-accuracy.md remain, run via the parent's browser
tasks. Mark PUBLISHED LIVE in the registry once the gateway test
returns 200.
